<strong>The Raven</strong><br>
<strong>A Christmas Tale, told by a school-boy to his little brothers and sisters.</strong><br><br>
Underneath an old oak tree<br>
There was of swine a huge company<br>
That grunted as they crunched the mast:<br>
For that was ripe, and fell full fast.<br>
Then they trotted away, for the wind grew high:<br>
One acorn they left, and no more might you spy.<br>
Next came a Raven, that liked not such folly:<br>
He belonged, they did say, to the witch Melancholy!<br>
Blacker was he than blackest jet,<br>
Flew low in the rain, and his feathers not wet.<br>
He picked up the acorn and buried it straight<br>
By the side of a river both deep and great.</p>
<dl>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">Where then did the Raven Go?</dd>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">He went high and low,</dd>
</dl>
<p>Over hill, over dale, did the black Raven go.</p>
<dl>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">Many Autumns, many Springs</dd>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">Travelled he with wandering wings:</dd>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">Many summers, many Winters--</dd>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">I can't tell half his adventures.</dd>

<p>
At length he came back, and with him a She<br>
And the acorn was grown to a tall oak tree.<br>
They built them a nest in the topmost bough,<br>
And young ones they had, and were happy enow.<br>
But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise,<br>
His brow, like a pent-house, hung over his eyes.<br>
He'd an axe in his hand, not a word he spoke,<br>
But with many a hem! and a sturdy stroke,<br>
At length he brought down the poor Raven's own oak.<br>
His young ones were killed; for they could not depart,<br>
And their mother did die of a broken heart.</p>
<p><br>
The boughs from the trunk the woodman did sever;<br>
And they floated it down on the course of the river.<br>
They sawed it in planks, and its bark they did strip,<br>
And with this tree and others they made a good ship.<br>
The ship, it was launched; but in sight of the land<br>
Such a storm there did rise as no ship would withstand.<br>
It bulged on a rock, and the waves rush'd in fast;<br>
Round and round flew the Raven, and cawed to the blast.<br>
He heard the last shriek of the perishing souls--<br>
See! see! o'er the topmast the mad water rolls!</p>
<dl>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">Right glad was the Raven, and off he went fleet,</dd>
</dl>
<p>And Death riding home on a cloud he did meet,<br>
And he thank'd him again and again for this treat:</p>
<dl>
<dd style="margin-left: 1.6em;">They had taken his all, and REVENGE IT WAS SWEET!</dd>
