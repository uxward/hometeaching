1.image.title=This pulsar map was sent as part of the plaques on Pioneers 10 and 11 and Voyager. It shows the location of earth's solar system with respect to 14 pulsars, whose precise periods are given. The two circles in the middle left is a drawing of the hydrogen atom in its two lowest states, with a connecting line and digit 1 to indicate that the time interval associated with the transition from one state to the other is to be used as the fundamental time scale.

2.image.title=There are many references to ravens in legends and literature. Most of these refer to the widespread common raven. Because of its black plumage, croaking call, and diet of carrion, the raven has long been considered a bird of ill omen and of interest to creators of myths and legends.

3.image.title=Tardigrades are frequently referred to as water bears or moss piglets.  Pictured here in a color-enhanced electron micrograph, a millimeter-long tardigrade crawls on moss.
3.hero=Of all the animals on Earth the tardigrade might be the best candidate for being an alien. Tardigrades are able to go for decades without food or water, can survive temperatures from near absolute zero to well above the boiling point of water, can survive pressures from near zero to well above that on ocean floors, and can survive direct exposure to dangerous radiations. The far-ranging survivability of these extremophiles was tested in 2011 outside an orbiting space shuttle. Tardigrades are so durable partly because they can repair their own DNA and reduce their body water content to a few percent.  Tardigrades are more common than humans across most of the Earth.

4.image.title=Cypresses was painted in late June 1889, shortly after Van Gogh began his yearlong stay at the asylum in Saint-Rémy. The subject, which he found "beautiful as regards lines and proportions, like an Egyptian obelisk," both captivated and challenged the artist: "It's the dark-patch in a sun-drenched landscape, but it's one of the most interesting dark notes, the most difficult to hit off exactly that I can imagine." One of two close-up views of the "very tall and massive" trees in a vertical format (the other is in the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo), Cypresses was shown in the 1890 Salon des Indépendants.
4.hero=One of Van Gogh's most popular and widely known series is his cypresses. During the summer of 1889, at sister Wil's request, he made several smaller versions of Wheat Field with Cypresses. These works are characterised by swirls and densely painted impasto, and produced one of his best-known paintings, The Starry Night. Other works from the series include Olive Trees with the Alpilles in the Background (1889) Cypresses (1889), Cypresses with Two Figures (1889\u20131890), Wheat Field with Cypresses (1889), (Van Gogh made several versions of this painting that year), Road with Cypress and Star (1890), and Starry Night Over the Rhone (1888). They have become synonymous with Van Gogh's work through their stylistic uniqueness.
