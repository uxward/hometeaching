0.image.title=In the 1982 movie Blade Runner, Dr. Eldon Tyrell is the genius who has built up the large Tyrell Corporation. His creations are human replicants, some of whom have been given away as an incentive for people to emigrate to the off-world colonies. Others are used in combat to protect those settlers. One of these replicants, Roy Batty, finds Tyrell and asks him to extend his life beyond the four-year limit built into Nexus Six replicants.  When Tyrell refuses Batty kills him.
